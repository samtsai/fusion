Support for iCal is currently in beta, and supports only events with daily and weekly recurrence.  If you import an iCal file and do not achieve the expected result, please email <a href="mailto:matthew.snider@gmail.com"> matthew.snider@gmail.com</a> with the iCal file used and a description of when and how often the event is supposed to occur.
