 echo "<div class=\"block\">Fusion does not send spam or sell email addresses.
<p>
Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to our users' privacy, we will disclose our information and privacy practices below.
<p>
<div class=\"bold\">1.	About Fusion and the Information We Collect</div>
Fusion is an online planner and calendar site that helps people plan their schedules and share them with their friends. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles and privacy settings. Their name and e-mail address are the only information required to be listed in their Personal Info.
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">2.	Information Collected by Fusion</div>
Fusion collects user-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify users and send notifications related to use of the site, as well as user-submitted profile information such as phone number and AIM screen name. Fusion also collects information that is not personally identifiable and not submitted directly by users, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all users to the site. 
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">3.	Use of Information Obtained by Fusion</div>
Profile information, as well as name, email and AIM screen name, are displayed to people in the groups specified in a user's privacy settings to support the function of the site. Except when inviting a friend to join the site, a user's name and email will never be given to anyone outside the site. We use server, IP and browser type for site administration. E-mails are only sent during the meeting request process or if you have been invited to a group.
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">4.	Spam Policy</div>
Email addresses will never be sold to anyone, and they will not be used for spam or any other purpose outside of the site itself.
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">5.	How can I control the privacy of my Fusion Site?</div>
You have complete control over the privacy of your schedule. No one else will be able to see the details (Title, Description) of your personal events. Group members will only see the time span of your scheduled events blocked out on their group schedule. Group members are also able to see whether or not you have accepted/rejected a group invitation, and whether or not you have confirmed a meeting request. 
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">6.	Links</div>
This site may contain links to other websites. Fusion is not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">7.	Use of Cookies</div>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the users close the browser or logs out. We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user.
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">8.	Changing or Removing Information</div>
Fusion users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately and old information will never be displayed to any user of the site.
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">9.	Third Party Advertising</div>
Luckily there is no third party advertisement on the Fusion site due to its nature as a student project. However, if any third party advertisers are interested in sponsoring our website, please contact the webmaster to discuss an offer (at least 1000 dollars a month per team member).
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">10.	Security</div>
Fusion accounts are password-protected. This web site takes every precaution to protect information our users select as private. We use industry standard measures to protect information stored in our database. Access to your information is limited to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us.
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">11.	Changes in Our Privacy Policy</div>
We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users by placing a notice on our site or via e-mail.
<p> 	 
<div class=\"bold\">12.	Contacting the Web Site</div>
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this web site, please contact us.</div>";
